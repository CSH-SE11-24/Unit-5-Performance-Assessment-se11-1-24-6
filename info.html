  <p class = "stats">During the 2021–2022 enrollment period, Black women made up 9.4% of women in medical school. This is compared to
    8.9% the prior year. Moreover, Black women made up 4.6% (2020–2021), and 4.5% of the total enrollment population,
    statistics that have remained relatively stagnant over time. Comparatively, Black women only make up 2% of the
    active physician workforce. Numbers inconsistent with the approximately 6.8% of Black women represented in society.
  </p>


<p class ="stats">Not only do we need to think about how this harms black women seeking a career in medicine, but also Black women seeking medical treatment too. A growing body of research aims to better understand how and why patient and doctor race can influence care. Studies have shown correlations including a reduction in infant mortality, greater patient adherence to health care guidelines, higher patient satisfaction, and better patient understanding of cancer risks. One recent study found that the life expectancy of Black residents increased in counties with greater percentages of Black primary care physicians. This shows the need for more black female doctors. More black female doctors, means better care for black patients.</p>
