Functionality of the website (descriptions of each of the pages and what they do)

  //  My home page introduce the user to my cause and offers some introduction to the website and what I'm discussing. I have a video that pops up at the click of a button so that the user can learn more about what I'm talking  about

  the info page is more statistics and research about the Problem I am talking about. Since I'm talking about the things that prevent black women from accomplishing great careers in medicine, I decided to have a part that celebrates the acheivements of black women who have accomplished so many great things in medicine.

  My sources page lists out all the sources I used for this website to give the user a chance to learn on their own and interact with this cause more deeply.
